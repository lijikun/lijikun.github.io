Welcome to my homepage!

I am a physical chemist with a multidisciplinary background, currently working as an assistant professor at [the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICCAS)](http://www.iccas.ac.cn). My ICCAS webpage (in Chinese) is [here](http://jczhao.iccas.ac.cn/jkli) where you can find position(s) available in the lab. 

A list of publications is available on my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3355-6518) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MAgDzgwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) profiles. 

Main research areas:
 
 - **Transition metal chemistry**: Mechanistic studies of heterogeneous photocatalysts with active centers containing d-block metals. We probe, at the atomic/molecular level, the coordination environment, valence and spin states of metal centers, and other structural details of key complexes and intermediates.
 - **Organic radical and semiconductor chemistry**: We study the electronic and atomic transfer processes, dynamics of excitons and carriers in redox-active condensed organic materials, such as organic heterogeneous photocatalysts, organic semiconductors, and environmental particulate matter.
 - **Advanced Magnetic Resonance**: We develop and apply experimental techniques for Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) spectroscopies, as well as theoretical/computational modeling of relevant spin systems.

Besides scientific research, I am also an amateur computer programmer in competitive algorithm contests, and an adept Linux user. See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lijikun) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/lijikun/).

I am also a slow (but tenacious) runner, a pretty decent cook and an avid podcast listener. I currently recommend the following podcasts, in no particular order:

- [Revolutions by Mike Duncan](https://www.revolutionspodcast.com)
- [History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps by Adam Peterson](https://historyofphilosophy.net)
- [Mindscape Podcast by Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/)
