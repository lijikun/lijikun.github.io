Welcome to my homepage!

I am a physical chemist with a multidisciplinary background, currently an assistant professor at [the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICCAS)](http://www.iccas.ac.cn). My ICCAS webpage (in Chinese) is [here](http://jczhao.iccas.ac.cn/jkli) where you can find position(s) available in the lab. 

A list of my publications is available on my [ORCID record](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3355-6518) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MAgDzgwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

Brief vitae:

 - 2021-Present : Assistant Professor, ICCAS
 - 2015-2020: Postdoctoral Researcher, Carnegie Mellon University (Advisor: Prof. Yisong Guo)

 - 2004-2008: B. Sc., Physics, Yuanpei Pilot Program, Peking University 

Besides scientific research, I am an amateur computer programmer who used to participate in competitive algorithm contests, and a pretty adept Linux user. See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lijikun) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/lijikun/).

I am also a slow (but tenacious) runner and a pretty decent cook -- these two hobbies ain't exactly related, but both would fit an avid, multitasking podcast listener. I currently recommend the following podcasts, in no particular order:

- [Revolutions by Mike Duncan](https://www.revolutionspodcast.com)
- [History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps by Adam Peterson](https://historyofphilosophy.net)
- [Mindscape Podcast by Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/)
