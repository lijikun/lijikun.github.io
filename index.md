Welcome to my homepage!

I'm actually a physical chemist with a fairly multidisciplinary background, currently as an assistant professor at [the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICCAS)](http://www.iccas.ac.cn). My ICCAS (in Chinese) webpage is [here](http://jczhao.iccas.ac.cn/68) and you can find positions available in my lab. You can also see my Vitae on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lijikun), as well as a list of publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MAgDzgwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) or [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AAZ-7887-2020). 

I'm also an amateur computer programmer (used to engage in competitive algorithm contests) and an adept Linux aficianado. See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lijikun) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/lijikun/).

I'm also a slow (but tenacious) runner and a pretty decent cook -- the two hobbies ain't exactly related, but both would fit an avid, multitasking podcast listener. I currently recommend the following podcasts, in no particular order:

- [Revolutions by Mike Duncan](https://www.revolutionspodcast.com)
- [History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps by Adam Peterson](https://historyofphilosophy.net)
- [Mindscape Podcast by Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/)
- [Planet Money by NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/)
- [Conversations With Tyler by Tyler Cowen](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler)
- [In Our Time by BBC Radio 4](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads)
