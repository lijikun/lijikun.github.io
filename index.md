I am a chemist and physicist, currently working as an assistant professor at [the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICCAS)](http://www.iccas.ac.cn). 

An up-to-date list of publications is available on my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3355-6518) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MAgDzgwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) profiles. 

Main areas of research:
 
 - **Transition metal chemistry in heterogeneous catalysis**: We explore the mechanistic aspects of heterogeneous thermo-/electro-/photo-catalysts with active centers having d-block metals. We probe, at the atomic/molecular level, the coordination environment, redox & spin states of metal centers, and other structural details of key complexes and intermediates.
 - **Organic radical and semiconductor chemistry in the condensed phase**: We study the electronic and atomic transfer processes, dynamics of excitons and carriers in redox-active condensed organic matter, such as organic heterogeneous photocatalysts, organic semiconductors, and environmental particulate matter.
 - **Advanced magnetic resonance techniques**: We develop and apply experimental techniques for Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) spectroscopies. We also model relevant spin systems by theoretical and computational means.

Besides scientific research, I also take a great interest in computers, including high-performance computing (HPC), competitive algorithm contests, and Linux system engineering. See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lijikun) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/lijikun/).

I am also an amateur marathoner, a pretty decent cook, and an avid podcast listener. A few good podcasts that I follow, in no particular order:
