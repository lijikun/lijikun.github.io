Welcome to my homepage!

I'm actually a physical chemist working on various multidisciplinary projects, currently as an assistant professor at [the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICCAS)](http://www.iccas.ac.cn). You can see my Vitae on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lijikun), and a list of publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MAgDzgwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) or [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/3919241/jikun-li/). 

I'm also an amateur computer programmer (used to engage in competitive algorithm contests) and an adept Linux aficianado. See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lijikun) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/lijikun/).

I'm also a slow but tenacious runner and a pretty decent Sichuan cook -- the two hobbies ain't apparently related, but both would fit an avid podcast listener. I currently recommend the following podcasts (in no particular order):
