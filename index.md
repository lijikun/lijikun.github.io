Welcome to my homepage!

I am actually a physical chemist with a fairly multidisciplinary background, currently working as an assistant professor at [the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICCAS)](http://www.iccas.ac.cn). My ICCAS (in Chinese) webpage is [here](http://jczhao.iccas.ac.cn/68) where you can find position(s) available in my lab. 

Please also see my Vitae on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lijikun), as well as a list of publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MAgDzgwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) or [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AAZ-7887-2020). 

Besides scientific research, I am an amateur computer programmer who used to participate in competitive algorithm contests, and a pretty adept Linux user. See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lijikun) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/lijikun/).

I am also a slow (but tenacious) runner and a pretty decent cook -- these two hobbies ain't exactly related, but both would fit an avid, multitasking podcast listener. I currently recommend the following podcasts, in no particular order:

- [Revolutions by Mike Duncan](https://www.revolutionspodcast.com)
- [History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps by Adam Peterson](https://historyofphilosophy.net)
- [Mindscape Podcast by Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/)
- [Planet Money by NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/)
- [Conversations With Tyler by Tyler Cowen](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler)
- [In Our Time by BBC Radio 4](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads)
